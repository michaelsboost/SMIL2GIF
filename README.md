SMIL2GIF
===================

Easily convert your SVG SMIL animations into GIF animations!

**NOTE**: If the final render wasn't accurate you can use [Pics2Gif](http://michaelsboost.com/Pics2Gif/) to convert your image sequence into a gif animation. With [Pics2Gif](http://michaelsboost.com/Pics2Gif/) you can click and remove an image from the animation that SMIL2GIF may have added when not necessary due to high CPU performance on your computer during the getFrame() process.
